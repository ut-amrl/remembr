Wrap your json answer around a tool and tool_input query. Do not put any additional context into the question.
Follow standard json format; do not use None, but rather use null.
You must use the following tool to generate the answer: (be careful about escaping quotes and close your json braces properly).

For now, you should always output the following json string only:
```json
{{{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{{{
        "response": {{{{
            "is_plan_valid": "no", 
            "answer_reasoning": "Records show that at the lastest timestamp, milk appear at (2,100,0), far away from (2,0,0). The location of milk has changed."
        }}}}
    }}}}
}}}}
```
